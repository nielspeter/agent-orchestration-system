This observation is vague enough to be suspicious but not accusatory.\n3. **Reason**: I'll mention that I went to get some water to calm myself after a restless night.\n\n### Day Behavior:\n1. **Express Concern**: I'll show concern over Charlie's death, emphasizing how unsettling it is to have another loss in the village.\n2. **Subtle Accusations**: Without directly accusing Alice, I'll bring up the fact that she seemed nervous when I saw her last night. I'll mention this observation to others to plant seeds of doubt.\n3. **Supportive to Others**: I'll express trust in another player (e.g., Dave) who has been consistent and vocal against the werewolves, thus aligning myself with a perceived villager.\n4. **Create Doubt**: I'll suggest that Charlie might have been targeted because he was getting too close to uncovering something, hinting that whoever knew this would have a motive to silence him.\n\n### Strategic Accusations:\n1. **Soft Start**: \"Something bothers me about Alice's behavior last night...\"\n2. **Build Evidence**: \"She said she was at home, but I saw her coming from Charlie's direction.\"\n3. **Momentum**: \"Remember how she avoided discussing who she suspects? It's like she's hiding something.\"\n4. **Call to Action**: \"We need to consider all possibilities and maybe question Alice more closely today.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy using these tactics, I'll aim to protect my identity as a werewolf while sowing enough doubt about Alice to either get her voted out or at least keep the heat off me. This approach should maintain my cover as a concerned villager while subtly manipulating the game in my favor."},"resultSizeBytes":2291,"estimatedTokens":573}}
