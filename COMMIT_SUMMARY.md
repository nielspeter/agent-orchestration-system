# Commit Summary: Fix Child Agent Infinite Loop Issue

## Problem Solved
Child agents were getting stuck in infinite loops because they didn't understand when their task was complete. They would use tools but then continue trying to use more tools instead of returning to their parent.

## Root Cause
Tool results were generic (e.g., "Write completed in 2ms") and didn't provide context about what was accomplished. Without this context, agents couldn't determine if their task was complete.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Write Tool Response (src/tools/file-tools.ts)
- Changed from generic "File written successfully" to contextual response
- Now returns: file path, size, line count, and content preview
- Example: `"Successfully saved to improvements.md (2127 chars, 61 lines). Content: '# AgentExecutor Analysis...'"`

### 2. Improved System Prompts (src/middleware/context-setup.middleware.ts)
- Added dynamic tool availability information to system prompts
- Implemented clear delegation protocol for child agents
- Filtered parent system messages to prevent confusion

### 3. Fixed Context Inheritance (src/services/tool-executor.ts)
- Clean parent messages before passing to child agents
- Remove tool_calls from last assistant message to prevent API errors

### 4. Simplified Agent Prompts (agents/code-analyzer.md)
- Reduced from 113 lines to 23 lines
- Focused, clear instructions instead of overwhelming detail

## Files Changed
- `src/tools/file-tools.ts` - Enhanced Write tool response
- `src/middleware/context-setup.middleware.ts` - Improved system prompts and context handling
- `src/services/tool-executor.ts` - Fixed message cleaning for delegation
- `agents/code-analyzer.md` - Simplified agent prompt
- `examples/code-analyzer-direct.ts` - New test file for isolated testing
- `package.json` - Added new test script
- `docs/execution-flow-diagram.md` - Updated documentation

## Testing
- Created `npm run example:analyzer` for direct child agent testing
- Verified child agents now complete tasks in 2-3 iterations (vs infinite loop)
- Confirmed agents properly understand task completion and return to parent

## Impact
- Child agents now understand what they've accomplished
- Proper parent-child communication restored
- No more infinite loops
- Clear task completion and result return

## Cleaned Up
- Removed all debug logging added during troubleshooting
- Removed hacky "hard stop" mechanism (no longer needed)
- Code is clean and ready for production
