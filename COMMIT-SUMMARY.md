# Commit Summary: Major Refactoring

## Overview
Complete 3-phase refactoring of the codebase plus critical fixes from code review.

## Changes Summary
- **168 files changed** (93 deletions, 34 modifications, 41 new files)
- **All tests passing** (80/80 unit tests)
- **TypeScript builds** successfully
- **Examples working** (all 10 examples run correctly)

## Phase 1: Quick Wins ✅
- Added barrel exports (index.ts) throughout codebase
- Renamed numbered examples (01-quickstart → quickstart)
- Moved agents/ to src/agents/
- Fixed tool type definitions
- Created src/types/ module

## Phase 2: Core Refactoring ✅
- Consolidated tool infrastructure in src/tools/registry/
- Flattened logging structure (src/core/logging/ → src/logging/)
- Clear domain separation achieved
- Extracted middleware into separate module
- Renamed directories (llm → providers, utils → lib)

## Phase 3: Polish ✅
- Added .tool.ts suffixes to all tool files
- Replaced all `any` types with proper types
- Added README.md files for major modules
- Consistent file naming conventions

## Critical Fixes ✅
- **Fixed broken tests**: Updated all calls from list()/get() to getAllTools()/getTool()
- **Fixed type cast**: Safe type checking in filterForAgent() instead of dangerous cast
- **Consolidated types**: Removed duplicate AgentDefinition from base-types.ts
- **Added error types**: Created specific error classes in tools/errors.ts
- **Added interface**: IToolRegistry for better abstraction
- **Fixed ESM exports**: Proper `export type` for type-only exports

## Additional Fixes ✅
- Updated package.json example scripts to unnumbered format
- Fixed all agent path references in examples
- Cleaned up .env.test (removed unused variables, mock API key)

## NOT Done (Intentionally)
- File renaming (registry.ts → tool-registry.ts) - not important for MVP
- Performance caching - not needed, methods only called once per execution
- Circular dependencies - none found during investigation

## Verification
- ✅ Build: TypeScript compiles without errors
- ✅ Tests: All 80 unit tests pass
- ✅ Lint: No errors (only pre-existing warnings)
- ✅ Format: Code formatted with Prettier
- ✅ Examples: All 10 examples run successfully
- ✅ No sensitive files included

## Ready to Commit
All changes have been verified and tested. The refactoring improves:
- Code organization (clear domain boundaries)
- Type safety (no dangerous casts, specific error types)
- Maintainability (consistent naming, proper abstractions)
- Developer experience (working examples, clear structure)
