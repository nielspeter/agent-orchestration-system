# AgentExecutor Improvement Proposal

## Current Strengths
- Robust agent execution framework
- Comprehensive logging
- Safety mechanisms for preventing runaway processes
- Support for nested agent delegation
- Concurrency management for tool calls

## Proposed Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Configurability
- Make safety limits configurable
- Allow custom token counting strategies
- Support pluggable logging mechanisms

```typescript
interface AgentExecutorConfig {
  maxIterations?: number;
  maxDepth?: number;
  maxTokens?: number;
  concurrencyLimit?: number;
  logger?: CustomLogger;
}

constructor(config: AgentExecutorConfig = {}) {
  this.config = {
    maxIterations: config.maxIterations || 20,
    // ... other defaults
  };
}
```

### 2. Advanced Error Handling
- Implement structured error classes
- Add retry mechanisms
- More granular error logging and reporting

```typescript
class AgentExecutionError extends Error {
  constructor(
    public code: string, 
    public details: Record<string, unknown>
  ) {
    super(`Agent Execution Failed: ${code}`);
  }
}
```

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- Adaptive concurrency based on system load
- More accurate token estimation
- Potential caching mechanisms for repeated tool calls

### 4. Code Complexity Reduction
- Break down large methods
- Use composition over complex conditionals
- Improve method-level separation of concerns

## Implementation Roadmap
1. Refactor configuration handling
2. Enhance error management
3. Implement performance improvements
4. Comprehensive testing of new features
