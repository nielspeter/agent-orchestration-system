const chain = new LLMChain({
  llm: new ChatAnthropic(),
  prompt: PromptTemplate.fromTemplate("...")
});

// This System
// Create agent.md file with prompt
const executor = await builder.withAgent('agent.md').build();
```

### From AutoGPT
- Define clear task boundaries
- Convert goals to agent prompts
- Add safety limits
- Implement as controlled workflows

## Conclusion

This agent orchestration system occupies a unique position in the landscape:

1. **Simpler than LangChain** but more structured than AutoGPT
2. **More flexible than CrewAI** but more opinionated than AutoGen
3. **More customizable than OpenAI Assistants** but requires self-hosting

The system excels at:
- Business process automation
- Cost-efficient operations
- Clean architecture
- Developer experience
- Production safety

It's ideal for teams that want:
- Full control over their agent system
- Simple, maintainable architecture
- Cost-effective LLM operations
- Production-ready safety features
- Quick development cycles

The system may not be the best choice if you need:
- Hundreds of pre-built integrations (use LangChain)
- Fully autonomous operations (use AutoGPT)
- Complex multi-agent simulations (use CrewAI)
- Managed infrastructure (use OpenAI Assistants)

Overall, this system represents a pragmatic, production-focused approach to agent orchestration that prioritizes simplicity, safety, and cost-efficiency over feature completeness.
