# Claude Code Hooks vs. Our Event-Driven Plans

## The Revelation 🎯

Claude Code's hooks system is essentially what we converged on after the senior review - **a pragmatic event system without over-engineering**.

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Aspect | Our Original Plan | Claude Code Hooks | Our Final Decision |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Approach** | Full event-driven rewrite | Simple hook points | Optional event hooks |
| **Complexity** | High (event bus, handlers) | Low (JSON config) | Low (optional emitter) |
| **Time to Implement** | 4-6 weeks | Already exists | 2-3 days |
| **Breaking Changes** | Yes | No | No |
| **Configuration** | Code-based handlers | JSON settings | Builder pattern |
| **Use Cases** | Theoretical | Actual user needs | Proven value |

## What Claude Code Got Right

### 1. **Specific Hook Points, Not Everything**
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [...],  // Not every single log event
    "PostToolUse": [...], // Just the important ones
  }
}
```

This matches our final recommendation: emit events only where valuable, not everywhere.

### 2. **User-Driven, Not Architecture-Driven**
Claude Code hooks solve **real user problems**:
- Validate before file writes
- Add security checks
- Custom logging
- Block dangerous operations

Not hypothetical "we might need metrics someday" problems.

### 3. **Simple Configuration**
```json
// Claude Code: Simple JSON
{
  "matcher": "Write",
  "command": "./validate.sh"
}
```

vs. our original plan:
```typescript
// Complex handler registration
new LoggingEventHandler(bus);
new MetricsHandler(bus);
new MonitoringHandler(bus);
```

### 4. **Command Pattern Over Event Bus**
Claude Code just runs commands/scripts. No complex event routing, no async handler management, no event ordering issues.

## The Lesson Learned

### Our Original Plan (Over-Engineered):
```
Executor → EventBus → Multiple Handlers → Async Processing → Storage
```

### Claude Code Approach (Pragmatic):
```
Tool → Check Hook → Run Command → Continue/Block
```

### What We Should Build:
```typescript
// Exactly like Claude Code hooks but in our system
interface AgentHooks {
  preToolUse?: (tool: string, params: any) => boolean | void;
  postToolUse?: (tool: string, result: any) => void;
  onAgentStart?: (agent: string) => void;
  onAgentComplete?: (agent: string) => void;
}

// Simple, optional, useful
.withHooks({
  preToolUse: (tool, params) => {
    if (tool === 'write' && params.path.includes('prod')) {
      return false; // Block
    }
  }
})
```

## Why Claude Code's Approach is Superior

1. **Proven in Production** - Real users are using it successfully
2. **Solves Real Problems** - Security, validation, customization
3. **Simple to Understand** - JSON config, not architectural diagrams
4. **Easy to Debug** - It's just running commands
5. **Optional** - Users only configure what they need

## The Irony

We went through:
1. Ambitious event-driven architecture (complex)
2. Senior review pushing back (realistic)
3. Converged on minimal hooks (pragmatic)
4. Discovered Claude Code already does this (validated)

## Implementation Recommendation

### Copy Claude Code's Approach Directly:

```typescript
interface HookConfig {
  type: 'command' | 'function';
  matcher?: string | RegExp;
  command?: string;
  function?: (context: HookContext) => HookResult;
}

interface SystemHooks {
  preToolUse?: HookConfig[];
  postToolUse?: HookConfig[];
  onUserPrompt?: HookConfig[];
  onAgentComplete?: HookConfig[];
}

// Usage matching Claude Code's simplicity
const system = AgentSystemBuilder.default()
  .withHooks({
    preToolUse: [{
      matcher: 'write',
      type: 'command',
      command: './scripts/validate-write.sh'
    }]
  })
  .build();
```

## The Humbling Conclusion

**Claude Code already implemented the right solution:**
- Not an event bus
- Not complex handlers
- Just simple hooks at important points
- Configured via JSON/settings
- Solving real user problems

## Final Verdict

❌ **Don't build our original event-driven plan**
✅ **Do copy Claude Code's hooks approach**

The fact that Claude Code - a production system used by thousands - chose simple hooks over complex events validates the senior review's skepticism.

## Next Steps

1. Study Claude Code's implementation more deeply
2. Implement similar hook points in our system
3. Start with the most useful: `preToolUse` for validation
4. Use Claude Code's hook names for consistency
5. Support both command and function hooks

## The Wisdom

> "Good programmers know how to write code. Great programmers know how to steal code."

Claude Code has already solved this problem elegantly. Let's learn from it rather than reinvent it.

**Note**: This is a perfect example of why researching existing solutions before designing new ones is crucial. Claude Code's hooks are exactly what we need - simple, pragmatic, and proven.
