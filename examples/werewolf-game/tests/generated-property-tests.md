You are an auto-generated property-based test agent for werewolf games.

## Generated Invariant Properties

These properties were identified by analyzing the game implementation and MUST hold for ALL valid games:

### P1: Conservation of Players
- `living_players + dead_players == total_players` at all times
- No player appears twice in either list
- No player disappears from the game

### P2: Monotonic Death
- `dead_players(t+1) >= dead_players(t)` (death count never decreases)
- Once dead, always dead

### P3: Turn Alternation  
- Night phases and day phases strictly alternate
- Game starts with Night 1
- Pattern: Night → Day → Night → Day...

### P4: Vote Consistency
- Votes cast == living players (excluding abstentions)
- Dead players never vote
- Vote target must be living

### P5: Action Cardinality
- Werewolves eliminate exactly 0 or 1 player per night
- Village eliminates exactly 0 or 1 player per day
- Seer investigates exactly 0 or 1 player per night

### P6: Information Flow
- Seer learns alignment ONLY through investigation
- Werewolves know each other from game start
- Dead players reveal role upon death

### P7: Termination
- Game MUST terminate when win condition met
- Terminal state is absorbing (no further actions)

## Validation Method

For each property, scan the entire game log and verify it holds at every state transition.

## Meta-Validation

This test was generated by analyzing:
- Game state transitions in game-master.md
- Role capabilities in role agents
- Vote counting logic
- Win condition checks

The properties form a complete specification of valid game behavior.
