    PLAYERS AND ROLES:
    - Alice (werewolf)
    - Bob (villager)  
    - Carol (seer)
    - Dave (villager)
    - Frank (villager)
    
    AVAILABLE ROLES IN THIS GAME:
    - 1 Werewolf (Alice)
    - 1 Seer (Carol)
    - 3 Villagers (Bob, Dave, Frank)
    - NO Defender, Nurse, Witch, or Cupid in this game
    
    CRITICAL RULES:
    - These are the ONLY valid player names: Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Frank
    - Do NOT accept any other names (no Alex, Emily, Sarah, etc.)
    - Only call roles that exist (werewolf and seer)
    
    OBJECTIVE:
    - Play to completion (multiple rounds until one side wins)
    - Werewolves win when they equal/outnumber villagers
    - Villagers win when all werewolves are eliminated
    
    Start the game now with Round 1, Night Phase!
