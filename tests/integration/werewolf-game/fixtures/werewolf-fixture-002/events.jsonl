This could have made him a target because werewolves may see him as a threat.\n- **Location and Activity**: I was at home, barricading my door, and I heard footsteps running past my window heading towards the direction of the church. This suggests someone was moving quickly after the attack.\n\n### Current Suspicions:\n1. **Alice**: Alice was quick to accuse Frank without much evidence in the previous discussions, which seemed opportunistic. This behavior could be an attempt to divert attention and create chaos.\n2. **Carol**: Carol has been very quiet during discussions, which might be an attempt to avoid drawing attention. Additionally, she was seen near the town square, but no one has been able to confirm her alibi.\n3. **Frank**: While Frank defended himself well against Alice’s accusations, his defense was a bit too rehearsed. It could be that he’s trying to hide something.\n\n### Supporting Observations:\n- **Movement and Sounds**: The footsteps I heard could be linked to anyone who claimed they were moving around the village late at night. This needs cross-verification with others who might have heard or seen something similar.\n- **Patterns and Voting**: Observing how people vote and defend each other can give us clues. Alice and Carol have shown a pattern of voting similarly, which might indicate coordination.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the current information, my top suspect is Alice due to her aggressive and unfounded accusations paired with the alignment in voting patterns with Carol.
