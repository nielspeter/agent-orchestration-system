If Bob is suspected of being insightful or possibly the Seer, removing him reduces the risk of being discovered.\n\n2. **Create Suspicion Between Remaining Players**: By eliminating Bob, the suspicion naturally falls on the remaining player, Alice, since she could be perceived as trying to shift blame or \"survive\" another round.
