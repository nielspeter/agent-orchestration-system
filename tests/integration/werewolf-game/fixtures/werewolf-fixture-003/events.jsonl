This can sometimes be a sign of guilt or fear of making a mistake.\n\n2. **Alibi Discrepancy**: Earlier, Bob claimed he was near the church, but Carol mentioned she saw him near the market at the same time. This inconsistency raises a red flag.\n\n3. **Pattern Observation**: Bob has managed to avoid being targeted in past eliminations, which might indicate that the werewolves are intentionally keeping him safe.\n\nBy voting for Bob, I can align with the group's growing suspicion and steer the conversation away from myself, maintaining my cover as a concerned villager."}}}
