# Critical Illness Claim Test Implementation Status

## Overview
Successfully implemented the test coverage plan to expand from 1 scenario (20% coverage) to 5 scenarios (100% coverage).

## Implementation Summary

### Test Scenarios Added
1. ✅ **happy-path** - Complete successful workflow (already existed)
2. ✅ **rejected-not-critical** - Hypertension claim (not critical illness)
3. ✅ **missing-docs** - Missing documents branch
4. ✅ **policy-rejected** - Waiting period violation  
5. ✅ **payment-failure** - Payment processing error

### Code Changes Made

#### 1. Updated Test Configuration (`claim-processing.test.ts`)
- Expanded `testScenarios` array from 1 to 5 scenarios
- Added expected outcomes, paths, and agents for each scenario
- Updated scenario-specific test conditions

#### 2. Test Fixture Generation
- Generated fixtures for all 5 scenarios
- Each fixture contains the event stream for replaying the workflow

### Current Test Results

| Scenario | Status | Issue |
|----------|--------|-------|
| happy-path | ✅ PASSING | All 10 tests pass |
| rejected-not-critical | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Hypertension not properly categorized as non-critical |
| missing-docs | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Documents identified but communication agent fails |
| policy-rejected | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Waiting period check not triggered |
| payment-failure | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Stops at missing docs instead of payment |

### Key Findings

1. **Agent Issues Identified**:
   - **notification-categorization**: Not distinguishing between critical illness (cancer, stroke, heart attack) and regular health claims (hypertension)
   - **communication**: Expects different input format than provided by orchestrator
   - **policy-assessment**: Not being called for waiting period validation
   - **payment-approval**: Not reached in payment failure scenario

2. **Workflow Gaps**:
   - The orchestrator doesn't properly handle non-critical illness categorization
   - Communication agent has incompatible interface expectations
   - Missing documents are incorrectly flagged even when all documents are present

### Next Steps for Full Implementation

1. **Fix Agent Logic**:
   - Update notification-categorization to properly identify non-critical illnesses
   - Fix communication agent input format expectations
   - Ensure policy-assessment checks waiting periods

2. **Fix Document Validation**:
   - Update happy_path_claim.json to include all required documents
   - Fix documentation-verification logic for stroke/heart attack claims

3. **Regenerate Fixtures**:
   - After fixing agent logic, regenerate fixtures for failing scenarios
   - Verify all scenarios follow expected paths

### Commands to Run Tests

```bash
# Run all critical illness tests
npm run test:integration:critical-illness

# Generate specific fixture (if needed)
npx tsx examples/critical-illness-claim/generate-fixture.ts claim-002

# Run tests with verbose output
npm run test:integration:critical-illness -- --reporter=verbose
```

## Conclusion

We've successfully implemented the test infrastructure for comprehensive workflow coverage (100% scenario coverage), expanding from 1 to 5 test scenarios. While not all tests pass due to agent logic issues, the test framework is now in place to validate all critical workflow branches:

- ✅ Happy path completion
- ✅ Early exit for non-critical illness
- ✅ Missing document handling
- ✅ Policy rejection for waiting period
- ✅ Payment failure handling

The failing tests have identified real issues in the agent implementation that need to be addressed for a production-ready system.
